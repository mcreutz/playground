Thougts:

Client shoud call mediator and not components. And the mediator should 
activeley mediate and not only connect.
-> Opposing view: When client calls components, data flow gets much easier. And 
more functional code can stay in the components. Also the one task of the 
mediator is to mediate, and not to act as a facade. This should be done by 
another class.

Necessary data does not need to be pushed by components in advance, but could 
be pulled from mediator after event notification.
-> Better, because a pull-method is more versatile.
-> Also, this eleminates the necessitiy of components pushing data to the mediator.
-> Components should only initiate communication to the mediator in case of an 
externally triggered event. Otherwiese the mediator should initiate the communication.
-> A message at communicating to the mediator could be omitted, when the 
mediator in return asks the reporting component, what its status is.

One own mediator for each multi-component operation?

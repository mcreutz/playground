You have been asked to create a playlist application that will be used on Android devices (using the Java language). We will assume that each playlist can be composed of songs or other playlists, or a combination of both.

Your project manager has told you that the composite pattern is best used in this situation. The following UML class diagram that communicates the applicationâ€™s objects and relationships using the composite pattern.

In this assignment you are required to complete the provided code. (Note: With the exception of the Playlist class, you do not need to actually implement the methods, just write filler comments (eg., // play song). With the Playlist class, write out the method to add songs to the playlist).
